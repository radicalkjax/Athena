Project Header
-----------------
This project is designed to serve the infosec community. No more wasted hours ripping apart and reordering code. 

Let Athena guide your way and unwravel the mysteries of obfusicated code so that you can be the best researcher you can be.

Project Athena
-----------------
Intended to be your go-to source for Malware deobfuscation and analysis assistant.
Choose the AI you'd like to deobfuscate or analyze. Both functions are very different and therefore require different agents trained for different jobs.

The app will connect to these agents hosted by their vendors.
With time, support for local agents will come as it is a major priority for this project.

OPEN SOURCE MODELS
-------------------
Hosted AI's : DeepSeek, Claude, genAI, openAI, CoPilot(?)

Local AI's: DeepSeek, Llama 3, GPT4ALL (4ever experimental as not all GPT4ALL models can be verified)

Need to reasearch:
    Perplexity (good at finding a presenting info [web scraping])
    DeepCodeAI (used to secure written code and searching for vulns)
    Codiga (Code quality analysis, useful?)
    Amazon CodeWhisperer (Coding assistant. AWS coding styles could be useful.)

OPEN SOURCE PLATFORMS
----------------------
Connection security for hosted AI's: Veilid (python || wasm)
Built using React-native
