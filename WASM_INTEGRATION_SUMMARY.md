# WASM Integration Summary

## Date: 2025-06-14

### What We Accomplished

1. **Fixed TypeScript Type Exports**
   - Added missing type exports in `services/aiProviders/types.ts`:
     - `OrchestrationStrategy`
     - `AIOrchestratorConfig` 
     - `AIAnalysisRequest` (alias for AnalysisRequest)
     - `AIAnalysisResponse` (alias for AIAnalysisResult)

2. **Fixed AIOrchestrator Method Access**
   - Made the following methods public in `orchestrator.ts`:
     - `getProviderStatus()` - Returns status of all AI providers
     - `getAvailableProviders()` - Returns list of available provider names
     - `selectBestProvider()` - Selects optimal provider for a request
   - Removed duplicate private `selectBestProvider` method

3. **Fixed WASM Analysis Engine Integration**
   - Fixed incorrect method call `analyzeCode()` → `analyze()`
   - Fixed initialization issue where `analysisEngine` was undefined
   - Updated to use the singleton instance correctly

### Current Status

✅ **Docker Compose**: All services running successfully
- API on port 3000
- Redis on port 6379  
- Prometheus on port 9091
- Grafana on port 3001

✅ **WASM Modules**: All initialized and functional
- analysis-engine v0.1.0
- crypto, deobfuscator, file-processor
- network, pattern-matcher, sandbox

✅ **Health Endpoint**: Working correctly at `/api/v1/health`

✅ **WASM Status Endpoint**: Working at `/api/v1/status/wasm`

### Testing Results

The WASM preprocessing pipeline is now working correctly:
- Detects malicious patterns (eval, prompt injection)
- Sanitizes URLs and dangerous content
- No more "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors
- Properly blocks malicious content before reaching AI providers

### Remaining TypeScript Issues

While the application runs correctly, there are still TypeScript compilation errors that should be addressed for better type safety:
- Missing property types in WASM bridge interfaces
- Decorator type compatibility issues
- Error handling type annotations

These don't prevent the application from running but should be fixed in future iterations.

### How to Test

```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/health | jq .

# Check WASM status
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/status/wasm | jq .

# Test analysis (will fail at AI providers due to invalid keys)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: test-key-123" \
  -d '{"content": "test", "analysisType": "GENERAL_ANALYSIS"}' | jq .
```

### Key Files Modified

1. `/workspaces/Athena/services/aiProviders/types.ts` - Added missing type exports
2. `/workspaces/Athena/services/aiProviders/orchestrator.ts` - Made methods public
3. `/workspaces/Athena/services/aiProviders/preprocessing/wasmPipeline.ts` - Fixed WASM integration
4. `/workspaces/Athena/services/aiProviders/index.ts` - Fixed export conflicts

### Notes

- The "password supplied but not required" Redis warning can be ignored
- AI providers show as unhealthy due to placeholder API keys (expected)
- WASM modules are loaded from `/workspaces/Athena/wasm-modules/core/`
- Branch: `WASM-posture`
