# Athena Migration Plan: React Native/Expo to Tauri v2 + SolidJS/Svelte

## Context
We have a malware analysis platform called Athena that currently uses React Native/Expo for the frontend. Due to persistent issues with Expo Router and the need for better desktop integration, we want to migrate to Tauri v2 with either SolidJS or Svelte as the frontend framework.

## Current Architecture Overview

### Frontend (React Native/Expo)
- **Main App**: Located in `/Athena/app/` directory
- **Components**: 
  - `AIModelSelector` - Selects AI models for analysis
  - `FileUploader` - Handles malware file uploads
  - `AnalysisResults` - Displays analysis results
  - `AnalysisOptionsPanel` - Container configuration options
  - `ContainerConfigSelector` - Selects container environments
  - `ContainerMonitoring` - Monitors container resources
  - Various UI components (ThemedText, ThemedView, ParallaxScrollView)
- **State Management**: Zustand store in `/Athena/store/`
- **Services**: API clients for OpenAI, Claude, Deepseek, local models
- **Styling**: Custom design system with tokens (colors, spacing, typography)

### Backend Services
- **API Platform**: Node.js/Express with various AI integrations
- **Container Management**: Docker-based isolation for malware analysis
- **WASM Modules**: Rust-based analysis tools compiled to WebAssembly
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistence
- **Cache**: Redis for performance

### Key Features to Migrate
1. AI model selection and management
2. File upload and analysis workflow
3. Real-time streaming analysis results
4. Container configuration and monitoring
5. Multiple AI provider integrations (OpenAI, Claude, Deepseek, local models)
6. Security features (secure storage, sandboxing)

## Migration Requirements

### Phase 1: Planning & Setup
Create a detailed plan that covers:

1. **Framework Selection**
   - Compare SolidJS vs Svelte for this use case
   - Consider performance, developer experience, and ecosystem
   - Recommend which framework suits Athena's needs better

2. **Tauri v2 Setup**
   - Desktop app configuration
   - Security considerations for malware analysis
   - File system access for malware samples
   - Integration with existing backend services

3. **Architecture Design**
   - Component structure translation (React → SolidJS/Svelte)
   - State management approach (Zustand → ?)
   - Routing solution
   - API integration patterns

### Phase 2: Component Migration Strategy

Map out how to convert each React Native component:

1. **Layout Components**
   - App layouts and navigation
   - Responsive design considerations
   - Theme system migration

2. **Core Components**
   - `AIModelSelector` → New implementation
   - `FileUploader` → Native file dialog integration
   - `AnalysisResults` → Real-time updates
   - `ContainerConfigSelector` → Form handling

3. **State Management**
   - Current Zustand stores structure
   - Recommended state solution for new framework
   - Migration path for existing store logic

### Phase 3: Feature Parity Checklist

Ensure all current features are accounted for:

1. **File Handling**
   - Drag & drop support
   - Multiple file selection
   - File type validation
   - Size restrictions

2. **Real-time Features**
   - Streaming analysis results
   - Progress indicators
   - Live container monitoring

3. **Security Features**
   - Secure storage of API keys
   - Sandboxed file handling
   - Permission management

### Phase 4: Integration Points

1. **Backend Services**
   - REST API compatibility
   - WebSocket connections for streaming
   - Authentication/authorization

2. **WASM Modules**
   - Integration approach in Tauri
   - Performance considerations
   - Module loading strategy

3. **External Services**
   - AI provider APIs
   - Container orchestration
   - Database connections

## Deliverables Needed

1. **Technology Decision Document**
   - SolidJS vs Svelte comparison matrix
   - Final recommendation with justification
   - Risk assessment

2. **Migration Roadmap**
   - Detailed timeline
   - Milestone definitions
   - Resource requirements

3. **Technical Specification**
   - New architecture diagrams
   - Component hierarchy
   - Data flow documentation
   - API integration patterns

4. **Proof of Concept Requirements**
   - Core features to demonstrate
   - Success criteria
   - Performance benchmarks

## Additional Considerations

1. **Development Workflow**
   - Build process changes
   - Testing strategy
   - CI/CD modifications

2. **User Experience**
   - Feature gaps between web and desktop
   - Native OS integration opportunities
   - Performance improvements expected

3. **Maintenance & Updates**
   - Auto-update mechanism
   - Version management
   - Backward compatibility

## Current Pain Points to Address

1. Expo Router configuration issues
2. Web vs native platform inconsistencies
3. Bundle size and performance
4. Complex polyfill requirements
5. Limited desktop-specific features

## Success Criteria

1. All current features working in Tauri
2. Improved performance metrics
3. Better desktop integration
4. Simplified development workflow
5. Reduced dependency complexity

Please analyze this migration requirement and provide:
1. A recommended technology stack (SolidJS or Svelte)
2. A detailed migration plan with phases
3. Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
4. Estimated timeline and effort
5. Proof of concept implementation guide for core features
