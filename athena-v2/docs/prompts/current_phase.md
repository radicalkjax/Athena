# Current Phase Status

## Active Phase: Phase 4 - State Management & WASM

## Current Session Goals

1. WASM runtime initialization ✅
2. WASM bridge components ✅
3. Performance monitoring setup ✅
4. Memory management implementation ✅
5. Error boundary components ✅

## Last Completed Task

**Task**: Implemented complete WASM runtime, performance monitoring, and memory management
**Date**: 2025-06-22
**Notes**: Created comprehensive WASM infrastructure:
- WASM runtime initialization in Tauri with wasmtime
- WASM bridge components for JS-WASM communication
- Performance monitoring system with FPS and metrics tracking
- Memory management with allocation tracking and garbage collection
- Error boundary implementation for graceful error handling
- Integration with analysis pipeline
- Memory pressure monitoring and automatic cleanup

## Current Working On

**Task**: Phase 4 Complete - Ready for Phase 5
**Started**: Complete
**Expected Completion**: Done
**Blockers**: None

## Next Up

1. Phase 5: Advanced Features
   - AI ensemble coordination
   - Advanced malware analysis features
   - Real-time collaboration features
   - Report generation system

## Important Context for This Phase

- WASM runtime using wasmtime 26.0.1
- Performance monitoring tracks FPS, memory, and custom metrics
- Memory manager enforces 500MB limit with automatic GC
- Error boundaries provide graceful failure recovery
- All components integrated and working
