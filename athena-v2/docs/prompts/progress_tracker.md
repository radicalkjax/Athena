# Migration Progress Tracker

## Overall Progress: 15% Complete

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ⏳

- [x] Tauri project initialized
- [x] Vite hybrid configuration working
- [x] Backend commands structure created
- [x] File upload command implemented
- [ ] WASM runtime initialized
- [x] Basic error handling implemented

**Status**: In Progress
**Notes**: Core Tauri structure is set up with basic file operations. Need to integrate WASM runtime next.

### Phase 2: Core Components ⏳

- [x] File upload area (SolidJS)
- [ ] Analysis provider context (SolidJS)
- [x] AI provider status (SolidJS)
- [ ] Panel routing system

**Status**: In Progress
**Notes**: Basic components created. Need to implement full panel routing and analysis context.

### Phase 3: Advanced Components

- [ ] Hex editor (SolidJS)
- [ ] Code editor with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Network traffic visualization
- [ ] Real-time data components
- [ ] Disassembly viewer

**Status**: Not Started
**Notes**:

### Phase 4: State Management & WASM

- [x] Global analysis store
- [ ] WASM bridge components
- [ ] Performance monitoring

- [ ] Report generation
- [ ] AI ensemble coordination
- [ ] Advanced configuration
- [ ] Export functionality

**Status**: Not Started
**Notes**:

### Phase 6: Performance & Testing

- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Bundle size optimization
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] E2E tests
- [ ] Production build testing

**Status**: Not Started
**Notes**:

## Performance Metrics

- Bundle size: Current N/A vs Target (<5MB)
- Startup time: Current N/A vs Target (<2s)
- Analysis performance: Current N/A vs Target (3-5x faster)
- Memory usage: Current N/A vs Acceptable
- WASM integration: Not Started vs Target (seamless)

## Known Issues

1. Drag and drop file upload not yet implemented in Tauri
2. Need to implement proper dialog plugin import
3. React Native code still present in original directory

## Next Session Priorities

1. Install dependencies and test the application
2. Implement missing panel routing
3. Add WASM runtime initialization

## Architecture Decisions Made

1. Using Tauri v2 beta for latest features
2. Hybrid SolidJS/Svelte approach - SolidJS for reactive components, Svelte for UI-heavy components
3. File operations handled through Tauri commands for security
