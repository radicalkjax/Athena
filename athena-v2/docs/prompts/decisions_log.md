# Architecture & Implementation Decisions

## Decision Log

### Decision #1: Framework Choice

**Date**: 2025-06-22
**Decision**: SolidJS for performance-critical components, Svelte for UI-heavy components
**Reasoning**: SolidJS provides fine-grained reactivity for real-time analysis data, Svelte offers simplicity for forms and layout
**Impact**: Hybrid build system required, but better performance overall
**Alternatives Considered**: Pure SolidJS, Pure Svelte, React
**Status**: Committed

### Decision #2: State Management

**Date**: 2025-06-22
**Decision**: SolidJS stores for reactive state management
**Reasoning**: Native to SolidJS, provides fine-grained reactivity, TypeScript support
**Impact**: Excellent performance for real-time updates
**Alternatives Considered**: Zustand, Redux, Context API
**Status**: Committed

### Decision #3: WASM Integration

**Date**: TBD
**Decision**: Pending
**Reasoning**: 
**Impact**: 
**Alternatives Considered**: 
**Status**: 

### Decision #4: File Upload Strategy

**Date**: 2025-06-22
**Decision**: Use Tauri commands for file operations with native file dialogs
**Reasoning**: Security and native performance, proper sandboxing
**Impact**: Can't use web File API directly, but better security
**Alternatives Considered**: Web File API, drag-and-drop only
**Status**: Committed

## Technical Patterns Established

1. **File Structure**: Component type determines framework (solid/ vs svelte/ directories)
2. **State Sharing**: Use SolidJS stores for reactive state, props for component communication
3. **Tauri Commands**: Async/await pattern with proper error handling
4. **Performance**: Lazy loading for heavy components, virtualization for large lists

## Conventions

- **Naming**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions
- **File Extensions**: `.tsx` for SolidJS, `.svelte` for Svelte
- **CSS**: Shared CSS custom properties, component-scoped styles
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error boundaries and user feedback

## Open Questions

1. Best approach for WASM module integration in Tauri
2. How to implement drag-and-drop file upload in Tauri v2
3. Optimal way to handle large file uploads with progress tracking
