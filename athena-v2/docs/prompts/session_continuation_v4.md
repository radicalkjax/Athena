## Known Issues (Non-Critical)

1. **TypeScript False Positives**: TypeScript shows errors for SolidJS JSX syntax, but builds succeed
2. **Port Conflict**: Port 5173 sometimes has conflicts. Use: `lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9`
3. **Disassembly**: Currently using mock implementation - real capstone integration pending
4. **Network Capture**: Currently using mock data - real pcap integration pending
5. **WASM Modules**: Using placeholder modules for testing - real analysis modules pending

## Next Steps (Phase 5)

1. **AI Ensemble Coordination**:
   - Create AI provider integration layer
   - Implement consensus analysis
   - Build result aggregation system
   - Add confidence scoring

2. **Advanced Malware Analysis**:
   - Implement behavioral analysis
   - Add sandbox escape detection
   - Create threat intelligence integration
   - Build YARA rule matching

3. **Report Generation**:
   - Create report templates
   - Implement PDF/HTML export
   - Add executive summaries
   - Build threat assessment ratings

## Important Files to Review

1. **Master Prompt**: `docs/prompts/master_tauri_prompt.md` - Full project plan
2. **Current Phase**: `docs/prompts/current_phase.md` - Phase 5 starting
3. **Progress Tracker**: `docs/prompts/progress_tracker.md` - 70% overall progress
4. **App Entry**: `src/App.tsx` - Main app with all component integrations

## Commands to Start

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/kali/Athena/Athena/athena-v2

# Kill any existing processes on port 5173
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true

# Start the development server
npm run tauri:dev

# Build the app
npm run tauri:build

# Frontend only
npm run dev

# Check Rust compilation
cd src-tauri && cargo check
```

## Architecture Decisions

1. **SolidJS**: Used for all performance-critical components
2. **Virtual Scrolling**: Implemented in hex editor and process viewer
3. **Mock Implementations**: Disassembly and network capture use mock data
4. **Modular Commands**: Separate Rust modules for different features
5. **Component Wrappers**: Analysis wrappers handle file loading
6. **WASM Runtime**: Using wasmtime for secure sandboxed execution
7. **Memory Management**: 500MB limit with automatic garbage collection
8. **Error Boundaries**: Graceful failure recovery throughout app

## Testing Status

- ✅ Frontend builds without errors
- ✅ Rust backend compiles successfully
- ✅ Tauri app builds and creates DMG
- ✅ All component integrations working
- ✅ Real-time monitoring functional
- ✅ WASM runtime operational
- ✅ Performance monitoring working
- ✅ Memory management enforced
- ✅ Error boundaries catching errors
- ⏳ AI ensemble integration pending
- ⏳ Real malware analysis pending

## Key Context

This is a sophisticated malware analysis platform with:
- AI ensemble analysis (6 models)
- Multi-stage analysis pipeline
- Binary analysis tools (hex editor, disassembly)
- Network traffic analysis
- Real-time system monitoring
- WASM runtime for sandboxed execution
- Performance and memory monitoring
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Control flow visualization

Maintain the "Barbie aesthetic" theme with pink accents (#ff6b9d) throughout the UI.
